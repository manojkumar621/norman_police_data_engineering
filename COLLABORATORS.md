Stackoverflow | https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37745801/how-can-i-extract-address-from-raw-text-using-nltk-in-python | Helped me come across pyap library while searching for ways to parse street address
Pyap library source code | https://github.com/vladimarius/pyap/blob/master/pyap/source_US/data.py | Gave me a comprehensive understanding in the address parsing logic, and this source code also has a 'street_address_type' variable that has all the street types that can possibly exist in the US. This helped me implement the variable in my code since I am not aware of all possibly street types, especially being a foriegn citizen
